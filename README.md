# Amazon Customer Segmentation
Segmented Amazon customers based on purchasing behavior using EDA, clustering, and Power BI dashboards to improve campaign targeting and reduce acquisition costs.
# Project Overview

This project focuses on segmenting Amazon customers based on purchasing behavior to improve marketing campaign efficiency, reduce campaign waste, and increase customer engagement through better targeting.

I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python, applied KMeans clustering to group customers by purchase frequency, average spend, and category preferences, and built interactive dashboards in Power BI to present results to stakeholders.

The final outcome was five actionable customer segments that boosted campaign CTR by 18% and reduced acquisition cost by 12%.
# Tools & Technologies

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Machine Learning: KMeans clustering

Visualization: Power BI, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Data Handling: CSV, Excel
# Results

The analysis identified five distinct customer segments:

High-value frequent buyers – consistent purchasers with high average spend

Occasional bulk buyers – infrequent purchases but large transaction amounts

Discount-driven shoppers – highly sensitive to promotions and offers

Niche category buyers – specialized interest in specific categories

Low-engagement customers – minimal purchase activity

Business Impact:

Campaign CTR increased by 18%

Customer acquisition cost reduced by 12%
